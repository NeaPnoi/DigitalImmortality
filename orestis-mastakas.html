      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Orestis Mastakas (Greek: Ορέστης Μάστακας; born in 1995) is a Greek activist, politician, 
        and researcher. He completed his PhD in Management studies at the University of St. Gallen 
        and holds an integrated master’s degree in electrical and computer engineering from the 
        National Technical University of Athens. He currently works as a Software Engineer at the Hellenic Ministry of Education. 
        His initiatives have received mixed press attention both in Greece and internationally.

      <h2>Student Union Involvement in Greece</h2>
      <p>
        During his undergraduate studies, Mastakas initiated his political engagement by establishing and leading 
        the Roman Revival university party, later rebranded as the Independent Student Movement. The platform 
        centered on opposing political party interference in university matters, advocating for campus cleanliness, 
        preventing squatting, and fostering academic excellence. In 2016, one of his promotional videos amassed 
        over 64,000 YouTube views, surpassing the highest viewed video on the official New Democracy student wing channel. 
        Reactions varied from neutral reporting (Neopolis.gr) to harsh criticism (Luben.tv), accusing him of 
        self-promotion. Despite this, the party, classified as “other right wing” in election results, 
        secured more votes than the student wings of both New Democracy and SYRIZA.

      <h2>Student Union Involvement in Switzerland</h2>
      <p>
        During his PhD studies at St. Gallen, Mastakas became active in the student union, focusing on equal 
        opportunities, transparency, and defending PhD student interests. Records suggest he may have been the 
        first external (non-resident) student elected across schools and programs, and to the university senate. 
        His 2022 bid for the presidency while living in Athens sparked controversy, including xenophobic emails 
        (“We cannot let dirty Greeks win the elections”), reported by 20 Minuten. Regulations were later amended 
        to ban non-resident students from presidency races.

      <h2>European Central Bank Representation</h2>
      <p>
        In late 2022, while at the European Central Bank, Mastakas organized the first “Trainee elections” to 
        elect representatives. He emphasized professionalism and fairness, and set up candidacy procedures. 
        The elections, delayed to November, aimed to appoint 5 representatives and 5 reserves. Later, trainees 
        won a €100 monthly salary increase (from €1070 to €1170), reported by Politico. Mastakas was praised 
        by IPSO but also criticized for organizing elections while standing as a candidate himself.

      <h2>Municipal Politics</h2>
      <p>
        In 2023, Mastakas attempted to participate in Galatsi’s municipal elections as leader of “Νέα Πνοή Γαλατσίου” 
        (New Breath of Galatsi). The youthful party focused on traffic, smart city initiatives, cleanliness, 
        welfare, and cultural activities. Local press coverage was mostly positive, highlighting the need for 
        young leaders with technical expertise. Despite attention, the party did not secure enough advisors to 
        enter the elections. A win would have made him among the youngest mayors in Greek history.
